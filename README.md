# Carl-bot Tag - Dank Memer Copy
Github for the Carl Memer Tag, I have no idea what to call this.

This project is not supported by either Carl-bot or Dank Memer, this is simply a fun project to teach me more about APIs and python in general.

This tag will be free to import with Carl-bot from discord: `ADD IMPORT LINK AND SHIT HERE LATER`

### API Endpoints
In essence this is creating an API so I might as well tell you its endpoints not that it would do much


### Setup/Installation
This is not meant for you to setup nor install, it will be complicated and tedious because I've tried to make this 100% free to host. Therefore I will not give any setup or tips, other then that feel free to use, change and edit all code.
I am not responsible or liable for any code taken from this repo.
